Project Outline: Training Intensity Analyzer with OpenAI API
1. Define Project Goals
Monitor your workout data (heart rate, speed, distance, etc.).
Use AI to analyze whether you are training too hard, too easy, or just right.
Provide real-time feedback and suggestions for adjustment.
Similar to the Garmin Training Effect feature, but utilizies my knowledge of running, vo2 max, sprinting and such to show if I am training at the correct level.
2. Collect Training Data
Gather data from fitness devices (heart rate monitors, smartwatches, etc.).
Store data including heart rate, speed, distance, time, and any subjective measures of effort (e.g., RPE - Rate of Perceived Exertion).
3. Data Preprocessing
Clean and normalize the collected data.
Feature engineering to extract relevant metrics such as average heart rate, peak heart rate, variance, etc.
4. Model Training (Optional)
If you want to create a custom model, you can train it on your data to classify training intensity.
Alternatively, you can use pre-trained models or directly use OpenAIâ€™s API for analysis.
5. Integration with OpenAI API
Use the OpenAI API to analyze the training data.
For instance, you can prompt the API to classify the workout intensity and provide feedback.
6. Real-Time Feedback System
Develop a system (mobile app, web app, or desktop application) that captures data in real-time and sends it to the OpenAI API.
Display feedback to the user regarding their training intensity and suggest adjustments.
7. User Interface
Design a user-friendly interface to display the results and feedback.
Include visualizations of the workout data and AI insights.
8. Testing and Iteration
Test the system thoroughly with real workout data.
Iterate based on feedback to improve accuracy and usability.
